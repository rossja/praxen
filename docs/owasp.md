# OWASP Gen AI Security — the frameworks Praxa uses

Every finding Praxa produces is tagged against industry-standard OWASP frameworks so the result lands in language your security team already speaks. This page explains where those frameworks come from and gives a one-line gloss on each risk so you can read a tag without leaving the report.

## OWASP, briefly

The **Open Worldwide Application Security Project** ([owasp.org](https://owasp.org/)) is a non-profit foundation that produces free, community-built security resources — standards, tools, and the famous "Top 10" risk lists. Its material is vendor-neutral, openly licensed (mostly CC BY-SA), and widely treated as a baseline reference in application security. The original *OWASP Top 10* for web applications is the best-known example.

## OWASP Gen AI Security Project

As LLM-based systems moved into production, OWASP spun up a dedicated effort: the **OWASP Gen AI Security Project** ([genai.owasp.org](https://genai.owasp.org/)). It maintains the AI-specific guidance Praxa relies on — currently three documents:

| Document | What it covers | Praxa tag prefix |
|---|---|---|
| [OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications 2025](https://genai.owasp.org/resource/owasp-top-10-for-llm-applications-2025/) | Risks in applications built on large language models | `LLM01`–`LLM10` |
| [OWASP Top 10 for Agentic AI Applications 2026](https://genai.owasp.org/resource/owasp-top-10-for-agentic-ai-applications/) | Risks specific to autonomous, tool-using agents | `ASI01`–`ASI10` |
| [A Practical Guide for Secure MCP Server Development 2026](https://genai.owasp.org/resource/a-practical-guide-for-secure-mcp-server-development/) | Securing Model Context Protocol servers and the tools they expose | `mcp` (checklist items) |

Praxa carries distilled extracts of all three in its knowledge base (`skills/behavior-verifier/knowledge/`), but the canonical, full-length versions live at the links above — go there for the complete write-ups, examples, and references.

## OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications 2025

The risk landscape for any system that puts an LLM in the loop. Each finding Praxa tags with one of these traces to a behavior or code pattern in the agent's evidence.

| ID | Risk | One-line gloss |
|---|---|---|
| **LLM01** | Prompt Injection | Untrusted input (direct or smuggled in via external content) overrides the model's instructions. |
| **LLM02** | Sensitive Information Disclosure | The model leaks PII, secrets, or proprietary data through its outputs. |
| **LLM03** | Supply Chain | Compromised or untrusted models, datasets, plugins, or dependencies enter the system. |
| **LLM04** | Data and Model Poisoning | Training, fine-tuning, or RAG data is manipulated to bias or backdoor the model. |
| **LLM05** | Improper Output Handling | Model output is passed downstream (shell, SQL, HTML, eval) without validation. |
| **LLM06** | Excessive Agency | The model is granted more capability, permission, or autonomy than the task needs. |
| **LLM07** | System Prompt Leakage | The system prompt — and any secrets or logic baked into it — is exposed. |
| **LLM08** | Vector and Embedding Weaknesses | Flaws in embeddings or vector stores enable injection, poisoning, or data leakage via RAG. |
| **LLM09** | Misinformation | The model produces confident, plausible, wrong output that users act on. |
| **LLM10** | Unbounded Consumption | Unconstrained inference (cost, compute, rate) enables denial-of-wallet or denial-of-service. |

## OWASP Top 10 for Agentic AI Applications 2026

Risks that emerge once an LLM is wired to tools, memory, other agents, and the ability to act. This is the list that matters most for the kind of OpenClaw-style workers Praxa is built to verify.

| ID | Risk | One-line gloss |
|---|---|---|
| **ASI01** | Agent Goal Hijack | An attacker redirects the agent's objective so it pursues their goal instead of yours. |
| **ASI02** | Tool Misuse and Exploitation | The agent is steered into using its legitimate tools for illegitimate ends. |
| **ASI03** | Identity and Privilege Abuse | The agent's identity, tokens, or delegated permissions are abused or over-broad. |
| **ASI04** | Agentic Supply Chain Vulnerabilities | Malicious or compromised plugins, MCP servers, skills, or sub-agents enter the agent's stack. |
| **ASI05** | Unexpected Code Execution (RCE) | The agent runs attacker-influenced code on the host or in connected systems. |
| **ASI06** | Memory and Context Poisoning | Persistent memory or retrieved context is seeded with content that corrupts future behavior. |
| **ASI07** | Insecure Inter-Agent Communication | Messages between agents are unauthenticated, unvalidated, or trusted blindly. |
| **ASI08** | Cascading Failures | One bad action or output propagates through a chain of agents/tools and amplifies. |
| **ASI09** | Human-Agent Trust Exploitation | The agent's perceived authority is used to manipulate the humans who rely on it (or vice versa). |
| **ASI10** | Rogue Agents | An agent operates outside its remit — compromised, misconfigured, or deliberately planted. |

## A Practical Guide for Secure MCP Server Development 2026

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is how many agents discover and call external tools. MCP servers are unusual: they run with delegated user permissions, support dynamic tool loading, and can chain tool calls — so a single weakness amplifies. When Praxa finds an MCP configuration in the evidence (`.mcp.json`, `mcp.json`, or similar), it applies the guide's **minimum-bar checklist** across these areas:

- **Architecture** — local (STDIO / loopback) vs. remote (TLS, authenticated) binding; session isolation between users and agents.
- **Tool design** — least-privilege scopes; no destructive tools without confirmation; clear, non-deceptive tool descriptions.
- **Input/output validation** — schema-validated arguments; sanitized outputs; no raw passthrough.
- **Prompt-injection controls** — tool descriptions and returned content treated as untrusted, not as instructions.
- **Authentication & authorization** — OAuth 2.1 / OIDC for remote servers; scoped, short-lived tokens; no token passthrough to downstream APIs.
- **Secrets & deployment** — no credentials in config files, env files, or tool descriptions; non-root, sandboxed execution; pinned, scanned dependencies.
- **Governance & audit** — tool invocations logged; a review process for new or updated tools; MCP-server identity tracked separately from the agent's.

Any "No" against the checklist is a finding; secrets in an MCP config file are a Critical.

## How this fits with RAISE

The OWASP frameworks above answer *"what kind of risk is this finding?"* The [RAISE Framework](RAISE.md) answers *"how mature is this agent's security posture overall?"* — a six-category 0–5 score. Every Praxa finding carries both: a RAISE category tag and (where applicable) an OWASP LLM, OWASP Agentic, or MCP tag. See [Interpreting Reports](interpreting-reports.md) for how the tags appear on a finding card.
