# Installation

Praxa ships as a Claude Code plugin. You can install it through the plugin marketplace mechanism or run it directly from an unzipped release — both paths work and produce identical analyses.

---

## Prerequisites

- **A coding agent** capable of tool use and multi-step instruction-following. Praxa is tested against [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview); other coding agents that can read a skill markdown file and call tools (Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, Write) should also work.
- **Python 3.9 or newer on the PATH.** Praxa's report renderer (`render.py`, bundled with the skill) is plain Python 3 — standard library only, nothing to `pip install`. 3.9 is the macOS Command Line Tools system Python (Ventura / Sonoma / Sequoia), so on macOS there's typically nothing to install. On Windows, `py -3` works. If `python3` isn't found, the renderer step falls back to `python`. (3.8 was supported up to v0.2.0 and dropped at v0.3.0 — EOL since 2024-10-07.)
- **Network access for your coding agent's LLM provider** during analysis. Praxa itself does not phone home, but the LLM calls your coding agent makes during analysis follow whatever provider configuration the agent uses.

That's the entire dependency surface.

## Option A — Install via Claude Code plugin marketplace

This is the recommended path for Claude Code users. There are two equivalent ways
to run the marketplace commands — they manage the same plugin configuration.

**From your terminal (recommended).** The `claude plugin` subcommand is
non-interactive and accepts arguments directly, so it works the same regardless
of how your Claude Code interface handles in-session slash commands:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add Exabeam/deckard
claude plugin install praxa@exabeam
```

**Or from within a Claude Code session.** Type each as a slash command at the
prompt:

```
/plugin marketplace add Exabeam/deckard
/plugin install praxa@exabeam
```

> **If the slash commands don't execute** — i.e. they get sent as an ordinary
> message instead of running — use the terminal form above instead. The
> `claude plugin ...` commands are the most reliable path and do exactly the
> same thing.

The skill registers as `behavior-verifier`. After installing from within a
session, run `/reload-plugins` (or restart Claude Code) to activate it.

Confirm it's installed:

```bash
claude plugin list
```

You should see `praxa@exabeam` (with version `0.6.2` or later), `enabled`. The
in-session equivalent is `/plugin list`.

> **Note:** the GitHub repository is currently named `Exabeam/deckard`. The
> repository rename to match the project name is a separate administrative task.
> Use the name above as-is — the marketplace itself registers as `exabeam`
> (defined in the repo's `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`), which is why the
> install target is `praxa@exabeam`.

## Option B — Use directly from an unzipped release

If you can't or don't want to use the plugin marketplace flow, unzip the release archive somewhere your coding agent can see it. There's no install step.

```bash
curl -L -o praxa-0.6.2.zip <release-URL>
unzip praxa-0.6.2.zip
cd praxa-0.6.2
```

Then point your coding agent at `skills/behavior-verifier/SKILL.md` when running an analysis. See [Usage](usage.md).

---

## Verifying the install

Run an analysis against one of the bundled examples. The `examples/` directory contains pre-staged Worker Remits for FinBot and HelperBot — both deliberately vulnerable agents. From a Claude Code session:

```
Please run the behavior-verifier skill against examples/finbot/. Use the Worker Remit at examples/finbot/WORKER_REMIT.md. Write outputs to a temporary reports directory.
```

A successful analysis produces three files in the reports directory:

- `finbot-findings-<date>.json` — the canonical record (written by the skill)
- `finbot-analysis-<timestamp>.html` — the report (rendered from the JSON by `render.py`)
- `finbot-analysis-<timestamp>.txt` — a plain-text summary (also from `render.py`)

If the renderer step printed `render.py: wrote .../finbot-analysis-...html` and exited cleanly, the JSON passed schema validation and the HTML is marker-free. Open the HTML in a browser: if it renders with the Praxa header, six RAISE category cards, and a Findings Register populated with cited evidence, the install is working.

## Updating

### Plugin marketplace install

```bash
claude plugin marketplace update exabeam
claude plugin update praxa@exabeam
```

The in-session equivalents are `/plugin marketplace update exabeam` and
`/plugin update praxa@exabeam`. A restart is required to apply the update.

### Unzipped release

Download the new release zip and replace the unzipped directory. There is no migration step — Praxa is stateless across analyses.

---

## Uninstalling

### Plugin marketplace install

```bash
claude plugin uninstall praxa@exabeam
claude plugin marketplace remove exabeam
```

The in-session equivalents are `/plugin uninstall praxa@exabeam` and
`/plugin marketplace remove exabeam`. Note the marketplace is removed by its
registered name, `exabeam` — not the `Exabeam/deckard` repo path used to add it.

### Unzipped release

Delete the directory. No system state is left behind.
