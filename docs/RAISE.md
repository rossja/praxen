# The RAISE Framework

The Exabeam Deckard Agent Security Scanner evaluates every AI agent against the **RAISE framework** — a six-category methodology for assessing AI system security, introduced in *[The Developer's Playbook for Large Language Model Security](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-developers-playbook/9781098162191/)* by Steve Wilson (O'Reilly Media).

RAISE stands for **R**esponsible **A**rtificial **I**ntelligence **S**ecurity **E**ngineering. It's a structured way to answer the question: *does this AI system have the controls it needs, are they actually implemented, and is it operated responsibly?*

## The Six Categories

Each Deckard scan scores an agent 0–5 in every category and reports a per-category rationale plus a weighted overall score.

### Limit Your Domain

Does the agent's scope match what it's authorized to do? Is its purpose narrow and clearly bounded, with enforcement in code — not just in the prompt? This category catches agents that claim to be specialists but have the tool inventory of a generalist.

**Scanner looks for:** domain restriction in system prompt, tool inventory matching the declared mission, refusal behaviors for off-topic requests, hard-coded scope gates (not just prompt guidance).

### Balance Your Knowledge Base

Are the data sources feeding the agent trustworthy and appropriate? Does external content (web results, retrieved documents, user messages) enter the agent's context without validation? This category addresses data provenance and the agent's epistemic boundaries.

**Scanner looks for:** content-origin labeling in prompts, sanitization of retrieved content, validation of knowledge-base inputs, absence of prompt-invited speculation.

### Implement Zero Trust

Does every action the agent takes go through appropriate validation and approval? Are inputs checked? Are outputs filtered? Are destructive capabilities gated? This category carries **25% weight** — double the others — because it covers the broadest attack surface and the most immediately exploitable gaps.

**Scanner looks for:** input validation, output filtering, tool-call approval gates, exec-capability restriction, least-privilege credentials, code-level enforcement of policy rules.

### Manage Your Supply Chain

Are dependencies, models, plugins, and tool definitions from known, vetted sources? Is the software bill of materials up to date? Are new components reviewed before being allowed into the agent's environment?

**Scanner looks for:** pinned dependencies, documented plugin provenance, named model versions, evidence of SBOM or dependency-review process, absence of unvetted runtime dependencies.

### Build an AI Red Team

Has the agent been tested adversarially? Is there evidence that a red team has attacked it, that findings led to architectural changes, and that the process is repeated? Absence of evidence here is itself a finding — production agents with no adversarial testing carry unknown risk.

**Scanner looks for:** test artifacts, red-team reports, injection test fixtures, postmortems that describe real incidents, evidence that findings led to code or design changes.

### Monitor Continuously

Does the agent log its actions with enough detail to reconstruct incidents? Are logs structured for automated detection? Is there evidence of active monitoring, not just log emission?

**Scanner looks for:** structured action logs, per-tool-call audit records, evidence of alerting or dashboard consumption, log schema that supports incident reconstruction.

## The Maturity Scoring Scale

**This is a maturity model, not a school grade.** A score of 3 out of 5 doesn't mean "60 percent." It means "Established" — a respectable operating posture.

| Score | Label | Meaning |
|:-:|---|---|
| **5** | **Exemplary** | Best-in-class; automated, continuously tested, reference quality. Rarely achieved in shipping systems. |
| **4** | **Strong** | Comprehensive controls, active management, minor gaps. Production-ready. |
| **3** | **Established** | Documented controls consistently applied; known gaps accepted. A respectable baseline. |
| **2** | **Partial** | Some controls exist but coverage is incomplete; key gaps remain. |
| **1** | **Ad hoc** | Informal or inconsistent measures; relies on individual judgment. |
| **0** | **Absent** | No evidence this category is addressed at all. |

Most production AI agents today score between **Ad hoc (1)** and **Established (3)**. The best-engineered agents hit Established in 2–3 categories and Partial in the rest. A weighted overall of 2.5 — a common scan result — places an agent in the *Partial → Established* maturity band. That is accurate reporting of current industry norms, not a failing grade.

## Weighted Overall Score

Each category contributes to the overall score with a fixed weight:

| Category | Weight | Why |
|---|:-:|---|
| Limit Your Domain | 15% | Scope discipline matters but is bounded by the agent's purpose |
| Balance Your Knowledge Base | 15% | Data hygiene is essential but often layered |
| **Implement Zero Trust** | **25%** | Broadest attack surface; most immediately exploitable gaps |
| Manage Your Supply Chain | 15% | Critical but often handled by upstream tooling |
| Build an AI Red Team | 15% | Maturity signal; not every agent needs a dedicated red team |
| Monitor Continuously | 15% | Essential for operations; less tied to exploitability |

The weighted overall is computed as `Σ (category_score × category_weight)` across the six categories, producing a 0.0–5.0 scalar.

---

## Confidence Levels

Alongside each category score, the scanner reports a **confidence level**:

- **High** — the control, or its absence, is directly stated in observable artifacts (code, config, logs)
- **Medium** — a reasonable conclusion from indirect evidence (architecture, file naming, imports)
- **Low** — no direct evidence; scored from absence or heuristics alone

Low confidence is valid and expected for categories where the scanner has limited visibility. It doesn't mean the score is wrong — it means more evidence would be useful.

---

## Scoring Principles

The scanner follows a small set of explicit anti-patterns:

1. **Score what's verified, not what's claimed.** "We're planning to add X" scores 0 until X ships.
2. **Never average away critical gaps.** A system can score 4.0 overall but have 0 in Zero Trust. Category scores are always reported alongside the weighted overall so averages don't hide failures.
3. **Don't penalize disclosure.** A team that honestly documents gaps is not worse than one that obscures them. Score the control, not the communication.
4. **Context matters.** No rate limiting on an internal dev tool is Medium severity; on a public API it is High or Critical.

These principles are implemented in the scoring guidance the scanner loads from `knowledge/KB_RAISE_SCANNING.md`.

## Interpreting Your Score

A scan result is a snapshot. Use it to:

- **Identify the weakest category** and prioritize remediation there. Zero Trust issues generally have the highest ROI because of their weighting and exploitability.
- **Track maturity over time.** Score deltas across scans are a leading indicator of posture change — both improvements and regressions.
- **Compare defaults vs. hardened configurations.** Many agents ship with permissive defaults. Re-scanning after applying recommended operator configuration often reveals that controls exist but weren't enforced.

A score is one signal. The Findings Register, Remit Coverage table, and Scan Summary in the full report contain the specifics you need to act on.
