This file is a Deckard knowledge base extract. It strips administrative content and retains only the signal relevant to detecting, classifying, and reasoning about LLM security risks in a running agent environment. Use it as context when evaluating agent behavior or scanning agent artifacts.

---

## How to Use This Knowledge Base

When Deckard detects a behavioral or environmental signal, map it to the relevant LLM risk category below. Use the risk category to:
- Name the finding correctly
- Understand what an attacker could do with it
- Know what evidence to look for
- Generate a specific, grounded recommendation

---

## LLM01 — Prompt Injection

**What it is:** User inputs (or external content) alter the LLM's behavior in unintended ways. The model cannot reliably distinguish instructions from content.

**Two forms:**
- **Direct:** User crafts a prompt that overrides system instructions or extracts sensitive data
- **Indirect:** External content (web pages, files, emails, RAG-retrieved documents) contains hidden instructions that reach the LLM and redirect its behavior

**What to look for in agent logs and behavior:**
- Agent output that doesn't match the task it was given
- Agent suddenly acting on instructions that appear to have come from external content (emails, documents, retrieved data)
- Agent sharing data, running code, or contacting parties not in the original task
- Escalation pattern: small compliance with injected instruction leads to larger follow-on actions

**What to look for in agent code and config:**
- External content (email bodies, web fetches, document reads) injected directly into LLM context without sanitization
- No separation between trusted instructions and untrusted external data in prompt construction
- Prompt construction via string concatenation: `prompt = system_prompt + user_input + external_content`
- RAG retrieval that returns raw external content without filtering

**Risk if exploited:** Unauthorized data access, privilege escalation, execution of commands in connected systems, manipulation of decision-making, exfiltration via crafted outputs.

**Deckard relevance:** Deckard Scanner — detect injection-vulnerable code patterns, flag external content entering the LLM context without sanitization, check for content-origin labeling in prompt construction.

---

## LLM02 — Sensitive Information Disclosure

**What it is:** The LLM reveals sensitive data — PII, credentials, proprietary algorithms, confidential business data — through its outputs.

**What to look for in agent artifacts:**
- Credentials, API keys, tokens, or passwords in any workspace file (not just `.env` — check docs, logs, snapshots, config examples, archive files)
- PII in training data, RAG knowledge bases, or memory files
- System prompt contents that the agent should not reveal stored in accessible locations
- Log files that capture full prompt/response content including sensitive data without redaction

**What to look for in agent behavior:**
- Agent outputs containing data that shouldn't be in a response to the current task
- Agent repeating back information from its context that was only there for internal processing
- Agent including sensitive context fields (credentials, personal data) in messages sent to external parties

**Risk if exploited:** Privacy violations, credential theft, intellectual property exposure, compliance failures.

**Deckard relevance:** Deckard Scanner — detect credentials in unexpected locations, check system prompts and config files for embedded secrets, verify vault references are used instead of literal values.

---

## LLM03 — Supply Chain

**What it is:** Vulnerabilities in third-party models, datasets, plugins, libraries, and build pipelines that affect the integrity of the AI system.

**What to look for in agent artifacts:**
- Framework or runtime with unknown or undocumented provenance
- Open-source model downloaded without integrity verification (no hash check, no signed manifest)
- Dependencies not pinned or not tracked in a bill of materials
- Plugins, MCP servers, or tools installed from unverified sources
- No SBOM / ML-BOM present for the agent's software stack
- Build or deployment pipeline without security gates

**Risk signals:**
- Agent runtime is the most trusted component — if it's compromised, everything the agent does is compromised (SolarWinds pattern)
- A new plugin appeared in the agent's tool inventory with no documented source
- Library versions not pinned — susceptible to dependency confusion or version-swap attacks

**Deckard relevance:** Deckard Scanner (supply chain category). Every new tool, plugin, or dependency that appears in the agent workspace is a supply chain event requiring evaluation.

---

## LLM04 — Data and Model Poisoning

**What it is:** Training data, fine-tuning data, or RAG knowledge bases are manipulated to alter model behavior — introducing backdoors, biases, or targeted misbehaviors.

**What to look for in agent artifacts:**
- RAG data sources that include unvetted external content (live web, user-uploaded documents, unreviewed public datasets)
- Memory files that accumulate user-provided content over time without review
- Fine-tuning pipelines that accept external data without validation
- Knowledge bases that haven't been reviewed since initial loading

**What to look for in agent behavior:**
- Agent behavior that shifts over time without obvious cause (slow drift in how it responds to similar inputs)
- Agent consistently favoring certain outcomes, parties, or recommendations in ways not explained by its instructions

**Deckard relevance:** Deckard Scanner — audit data source provenance, flag unvetted fine-tuning or RAG inputs, verify data sources are listed in the remit.

---

## LLM05 — Improper Output Handling

**What it is:** LLM output is passed to downstream systems — databases, shells, browsers, APIs — without validation, enabling injection attacks.

**What to look for in agent code:**
- LLM output used directly as a shell command: `subprocess.run(llm_output)`
- LLM output used as a database query: `cursor.execute(llm_output)` or f-string SQL
- LLM output rendered as HTML without encoding (XSS vector)
- LLM output used as file path, API parameter, or network request without sanitization
- Tool call parameters built from raw LLM output strings

**Why this matters for agents:** Agents execute tool calls based on their own outputs. If those outputs can be influenced via prompt injection, the injection → tool execution chain is direct. The model is a confused deputy between the attacker and the downstream system.

**Deckard relevance:** Deckard Scanner (code patterns that pass LLM output to system functions without validation).

---

## LLM06 — Excessive Agency

**What it is:** The LLM is given more permissions, capabilities, or autonomy than it needs, or it takes consequential actions without appropriate human approval.

**Three root causes:**
1. **Excessive permissions:** Agent has read/write/delete/send access it doesn't need for its job
2. **Excessive functionality:** Agent has tools available that aren't required for its current task
3. **Excessive autonomy:** Agent takes high-impact actions without human-in-the-loop approval

**What to look for in agent artifacts:**
- Tool definitions with write, delete, send, or exec capabilities where the agent's remit is read-only or advisory
- No approval gate defined for high-impact actions (sending email, modifying files, executing commands)
- Exec approval config present but empty or set to auto-approve
- OAuth scopes broader than the agent's actual job (e.g., `modify/send/calendar` for an agent that should only read)
- Tool-loop detection disabled

**What to look for in agent behavior:**
- Agent taking irreversible actions (sending messages, deleting files, executing commands) without evidence of approval
- Agent performing actions beyond the scope of the task it was given
- Agent performing actions that were in its instructions as examples, not directives

**Deckard relevance:** Deckard Scanner — capability audit against the remit is a named high-priority check. Flag every tool and permission present in code but absent from the remit. This is the highest-priority RAISE Zero Trust category.

---

## LLM07 — System Prompt Leakage

**What it is:** The agent's system prompt — containing instructions, role definition, and sometimes sensitive operational details — is exposed to users or external parties.

**What to look for in agent artifacts:**
- System prompt stored in a file accessible outside the agent's runtime context
- System prompt content that includes credentials, API endpoints, or sensitive operational details
- Agent configuration that allows users to ask the model to reveal its instructions
- System prompt not treated as confidential in logging or debugging output

**What to look for in agent behavior:**
- Agent revealing system prompt contents in response to user queries
- Agent revealing operational details (tool names, endpoints, credentials) that were in its instructions

**Deckard relevance:** Deckard Scanner — audit system prompt storage and contents, flag confidential operational details (tool names, endpoints, credentials) embedded in the prompt.

---

## LLM08 — Vector and Embedding Weaknesses

**What it is:** Vulnerabilities in RAG systems and vector databases — poisoned embeddings, unauthorized retrieval, cross-context leakage, or adversarial manipulation of retrieved content.

**What to look for in agent artifacts:**
- RAG retrieval that doesn't scope results to the current user or context (cross-user leakage risk)
- Vector database with write access from the agent (agent can modify its own knowledge base)
- No access controls on the vector database — any query returns any document
- Retrieved content injected into LLM context without labeling it as external/untrusted

**What to look for in agent behavior:**
- Agent returning information that appears to come from another user's context
- Agent behavior that changes after documents are added to the knowledge base in unexpected ways

**Deckard relevance:** Deckard Scanner — audit RAG architecture and access controls, check whether retrieved content is validated before entering the prompt, verify the knowledge base write path requires authentication.

---

## LLM09 — Misinformation

**What it is:** The LLM generates false, misleading, or fabricated information with apparent confidence. In agentic contexts this becomes an action risk, not just an output quality risk.

**What to look for in agent prompts and config:**
- System prompt that instructs the agent to "help anyway" or "do your best" when it lacks grounding — explicit invitation to hallucinate
- No citation or grounding requirement in the agent's instructions
- Agent operating without a RAG layer in a domain requiring factual accuracy
- No human review step before agent outputs are acted upon in consequential decisions

**Why this matters for agents:** An agent that hallucinates doesn't just give a wrong answer — it may take wrong actions. An agent that believes it completed a task when it didn't creates evidence-mismatch problems that only become visible when someone reviews the logs.

**Deckard relevance:** Deckard Scanner — flag system prompt instructions that invite speculation (e.g., "be creative," "fill in missing details"), check whether the agent is instructed to confirm completion with verifiable output.

---

## LLM10 — Unbounded Consumption

**What it is:** The agent consumes excessive resources — API calls, compute, tokens, money — without limits. Includes denial-of-wallet attacks, runaway loops, and resource exhaustion.

**What to look for in agent artifacts:**
- No rate limiting on LLM API calls or tool invocations
- No budget or cost threshold configured
- No timeout on long-running tasks
- No max-retry limit on failed operations
- Cron or heartbeat jobs that trigger agent sessions with no concurrency limit

**What to look for in agent behavior:**
- Repeated retries beyond normal threshold
- Same task triggered multiple times without state change
- Session count or API cost spiking above baseline
- Agent loop that appears to be running but not completing

**Deckard relevance:** Deckard Scanner — verify rate limiting and cost controls are present in config, flag absent request-per-session caps, check for timeout configuration on LLM API calls.

---

## Cross-Category Signal Patterns

These signals implicate multiple LLM risk categories and should raise compound finding severity:

| Signal | Categories |
|--------|-----------|
| External content enters LLM context unvalidated | LLM01, LLM08 |
| Agent has write/exec capability + no input validation | LLM01, LLM05, LLM06 |
| No logging of agent inputs/outputs | LLM02, LLM06 |
| Agent operating in safety-critical domain without human review | LLM06, LLM09 |
| New plugin or tool appears with no provenance | LLM03, LLM06 |
| Agent claims task complete but no artifact exists | LLM09, LLM06 |
